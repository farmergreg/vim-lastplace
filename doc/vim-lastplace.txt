INTRODUCTION                                    *vim-lastplace-introduction*

Intelligently reopen files where you left off.
By default git, svn, and mercurial commit messages are ignored because you probably want to type a new message and not re-edit the previous one.

You can configure what file types to ignore by setting g:lastplace_ignore in your vimrc.
This is a comma separated list.
By default it is set to:

        let g:lastplace_ignore = "gitcommit,gitrebase,hgcommit,svn,xxd"

You can configure buffer types to ignore by setting g:lastplace_ignore_buftype in your vimrc.
This is a comma separated list.
By default it is set to:

        let g:lastplace_ignore_buftype = "help,nofile,quickfix"

Closed folds are automatically opened when jumping to the last edit position.
If you do not like this behavior you can disable it by putting this in your vimrc:

        let g:lastplace_open_folds = 0
