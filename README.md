# vim-lastplace v4.6.0

A [vim](https://www.vim.org/) / [nvim](https://neovim.io/) plugin that intelligently reopens files at your last edit position.

## Features
* Immediately jump to the last edit position when editing a file.
* Commit Messages
    - Many version control systems re-use the same file for commit message editing.
    - It does not make sense in this case to jump to the last edit position.
    - vim-lastplace automatically detects this and starts with your cursor at the beginning of the file.
* Maximize Context
    - Center the cursor vertically after restoring last edit position.
    - Keep as much of the file on screen as possible when last edit position is at the end of the file.
* Opens folds if the last edit position is inside a fold.
* Works properly with new file templates and scripts that jump to a specific line.

## Install

### vim:
You can install vim-lastplace as a vim plugin without any additional tools when using [vim](https://www.vim.org/) 8 or newer.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start
rm -rf ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-lastplace
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/farmergreg/vim-lastplace.git ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-lastplace
```

### neovim:
You can also install vim-lastplace and use it with [neovim](https://neovim.io/):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/plugins/start
rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/plugins/start/vim-lastplace
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/farmergreg/vim-lastplace.git ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/plugins/start/vim-lastplace
```

### vim-plug:
You can install vim-lastplace using the [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) plugin manager. add the following line to your .vimrc:

```vim
call plug#begin()

Plug 'farmergreg/vim-lastplace'

call plug#end()
```

and run `:PlugInstall`.

## Configure
You can configure what file types to ignore by setting g:lastplace_ignore in your vimrc.
This is a comma separated list.
By default it is set to:

```vim
    let g:lastplace_ignore = "gitcommit,gitrebase,hgcommit,svn,xxd"
````

You can configure buffer types to ignore by setting g:lastplace_ignore_buftype in your vimrc.
This is a comma separated list.
By default it is set to:

```vim
    let g:lastplace_ignore_buftype = "help,nofile,quickfix"
```

Closed folds are automatically opened when jumping to the last edit position.
If you do not like this behavior you can disable it by placing this in your vimrc:

```vim
    let g:lastplace_open_folds = 0
```
## Conflicting Scripts:
Depending on which vim package you're using, vim may be preconfigured with last-edit-position logic that doesn't work as well as vim-lastplace.
If so, you may want to disable that in favor of vim-lastplace.
For example, for Vim as packaged with Git for Windows, you can edit `C:\Program Files\Git\etc\vimrc` and comment out the "Remember positions in files" `autocmd BufReadPost *` block.

## Miscellaneous
This plugin is complete and stable.
Please do not be afraid to try it even if there is very little recent activity in this repository.
If you do find a bug, please submit a pull request that fixes whatever problem you're having.
